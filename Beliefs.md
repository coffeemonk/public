My beliefs
==========

On Morality
-----------
* Underneath it all, we just want to be loved
* Love is love, and marriage is a commitment to and consecration of love.
* Distinctions invite prejudice. There's no such thing as "gay" marriage, there's just marriage.
* Our nature is essentially selfish. Putting others first takes work and requires perseverance and self awareness.
* Abortion should be legal but discouraged, and alternative options should be made easier.
* Assisted suicide should be a legal option for one of sound mind.
* Health care should be available to everyone.
* The death penalty should be used only in extreme cases, and to protect the public.
* The world's average morality is improving as it becomes more connected
* Industries and business which are demonstrably anti-consumer should be sanctioned or dissolved (publicly-owned insurance, big-pharma, Walmart, MPAA, RIAA, or any entity that exists for the pursuit of profit over the public interest.)
* Non-human entities (eg. businesses) should not enjoy the same legal status as a person.

On Freedom
----------
* Prisons should be about public protection and individual rehabilitiation.
* We shouldn't build bigger prisons, we should build a better, more just and equal world.
* Marijuana should be legal to grow, sell, buy, and carry
* Owning a gun should require training and certification, and no criminal record.
* Owning non-hunting (handguns and semi-automatic) firearms should require regular mental health evaluations.
* DRM is a blight, and should be eradicated.

On Spirituality
---------------
* Everything ends.
* Is there such a thing as a soul?
* If God exists, she is beyond my comprehension, definition, or control.
* Reality arises from perceived conditions, and is shaped by our perception of it.
* Astrology is entertainment
* Magic and miracles don't exist
* I doubt the concept of an afterlife
* Nevertheless, I trust some part of me will live on, even if only as atoms.
* Our purpose is not pre-determined; we are not guided by fate, but by choice.

On Science & The Universe
-------------------------
* I believe it possible that other dimensions and universes exist
* Micro and macro evolution happens through mutation and natural selection
* Something like the Big Bang probably happened
* Something had to have existed before the Big Bang (outside of time and space as we know them)
* Humans will eventually learn to travel "faster-than-light"
* The human brain (in its current state of evolution) can't fully comprehend the universe
* We have no cosmic significance
* Aliens must exist
* Non-carbon-based life forms must exist
* Humans will eventually travel to other stars
* Time travel is, most likely, not possible
* There is little to no chance we are living inside a "simulation"

On Health
---------
* We can change our behavior and habits (it requires a lot of energy)
* Consistently eating well and exercising is the best path to sustainable health
* Vaccines are good for babies and society
* Vaccines almost certainly do not cause autism
* The biggest boon to the scientific community are crackpots and charlatans
* The biggest threat to the scientific community are crackpots and charlatans
* Homeopathy is a sham.
* The best defense is moderate exercise, plenty of rest, plenty of water, and a well-balanced whole food-based diet.

+++ In progress +++

On Technology
-------------
* Computers will be building better computers than humans by 2050 (the Singularity)
* Humans, computers, and Earth will evolve into a super organism by 2200 (if we're still around)
* Humans that embrace change (and give up some of their humanity) will survive the Singularity
* Technology will eventually disrupt all other human-created institutions (politics, religion, identity, economics)

On The Self
-----------
* Free will is mostly an illusion (but does exist in limited form)
* Pure altruism is an illusion (but kindness is not)
* We tell stories in order to create and remember meaning
* Consciousness is the result of a feedback loop between our story-making cortex and our subconscious (ain't it nice though?)
* Privacy is not a human right, just a temporary side effect of not being truly connected to others
* Giving up our privacy and individuality in exchange for better connection will be the norm by 2050

On Logic
--------
* Most questions have no answer (asking them anyway is sometimes entertaining, but nothing else) 
* Logic is a helpful tool, but has flaws and can't be relied on entirely

On Education
------------
* Something will replace universities as we currently know them by 2030

On Politics & The Economy
-------------------------
* Most jobs lost in 2008-present aren't going to come back, new ones have to be created from scratch
* In the future, working will be more thoroughly decoupled from having the means to live
* We'll have a President that admits to being atheist or agnostic by 2025
* Power will be more quickly redistributed when it gets too heavy at the top

On The Future Of Earth (2100)
-----------------------------
* Global warming is real and will continue to cause big problems
* There will be 10 billion people
* 80% of people will live in cities and new mega-cities by 2100
* The number of living languages in the world will drop to under 100
* Genetically modified foods will become the norm
* Coral reefs and the ocean ecosystems are going to break with unknown consequences
* Solar and wind will slowly replace gas and oil 

On Biases
---------
* We tend to favor the beautiful
* We tend to see what we expect to see
* We tend to attribute too much credit to success (and under-credit luck)

On Love
-------
* Soulmates exist
* Love at first sight happens

Meta
----
* We have very little control over what we believe in
* Some of my beliefs will be proven wrong
* I'm willing to be convinced that my beliefs are wrong
* Making and maintaining this list is useful and fun (you should do it too)
